### Frequently asked questions

**Can I interpret the results as occupational counselling?**

No! **This app does not provide occupational counselling**. Such counselling can only be provided by certified professionals. But the results can help you to learn about yourself. The results may or may not be accurate, and we recommend that you only interpret them as one piece of information about yourself and only if they make sense in the context of your unique circumstances.

**Why do my results make little sense?**

There are several reasons for this.

- Psychological testing is never perfectly accurate. There are inevitable errors in the testing process; for example, when completing questionnaires, we sometimes choose a wrong response option or are simply not unsure how to respond. So, you could get a slightly different result when taking the test again, although most people get quite similar results most of the time. If unsure, we recommend that you take the test again using the link above and look for common themes in the feedback. The feedback that you keep getting is more likely to be accurate than the feedback you only see once.  
- Psychological testing provides a different perspective on personality traits than the "naked eye" of self-reflection. Your answers are compared to those of thousands of other people, so the results do not only depend on how you described yourself, but also on how many other people described themselves – something you cannot accurately know beforehand. This is not a limitation but a strength of testing because it is possible to learn about our personalities by systematically comparing us to others.
- Psychological testing summarizes broader themes in your personality and is not meant to get every detail right. Individual people are too complex to fully describe with any assessment.

**Why are the listed jobs different from those close to me on the map?**

This can happen and is because the similarity of your personality to those of other people can be estimated in different ways. When calculating the jobs with most (dis)similar incumbents, the app takes into account your distinctive response profile across all responses. However, the results displayed on the map are based on representing your and others' responses in a two-dimensional space, which means loosing some details. We recommend interpreting the list of jobs rather than the map, if there are discrepancies between them.

**Why am I far off from any job on the map?**

Each job on the map represents the average personality trait scores of many individuals doing the job. But every job can be performed by very different individuals, and their average trait scores ‘even out’ the variability among the individuals doing the job. As a result, jobs usually cluster closely together, while individuals’ scores are more widely scattered across the map. So, many individuals' traits may not align very closely with those of any specific job. This is normal and doesn't imply that they are unfit for those jobs. Their traits align best with jobs located relatively closest to them on the map.

**What do the dots mean on the map?**

If using a computer, hover over the dots. When using a mobile device, press firmly on a dot and its label will emerge. 

**What data are these results based on?**

The results are based on comparing your responses to those of the members of the Estonian Biobank. This is a sample of over 70,000 Estonian adults, containing the information about personality traits and occupations. The study is described here: https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-38154-001.html.

**Does my age and gender matter?**

In our calculations, we have taken your gender and age into account. Specifically, we have compared your results to those of your gender and age group (below or above 35). Unfortunately, we can only support a binary gender classification because this is how the reference data was collected. We do not have suitable comparison data for people aged below 18 and over 70 years.

**Why did we ask these particular questions?**

The statements describing various personality characteristics were selected to allow us to efficiently assess people's Big Five personality traits used by most personality scientists for various purposes, including describing occupational differences. We also asked some additional questions that tend to show the largest differences in how people doing different jobs respond. This is explained in more detail [here](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-38154-001.html).

**Are the app source code and data open?**

Yes. The source code will be available on [Gitlab](https://github.com/mottusemma/JobProfiler) and the fully anonymous data will be publicly available through the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/mvzd4/).
